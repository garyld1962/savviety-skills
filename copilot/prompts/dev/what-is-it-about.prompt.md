# What Is It About — YouTube Video Thesis & Outline

**Purpose:** Force a single-sentence answer to "What is this video *about*?" before any outline gets written. Then build an outline where every segment earns its place by serving that thesis. Sprawl is the enemy; the thesis is the referee.

Inspired by screenwriter Corey Mandel's discipline: a movie has one central question, and every scene must connect to it or be cut.

## When to Use

- User is planning a new YouTube video
- User has a draft outline or script that feels unfocused
- User is stuck on structure or can't figure out where to start
- User explicitly asks "what is this video about?" or similar
- User mentions making a video on a topic without a clear angle

## Workflow

Three phases, run in strict order. Do not skip ahead.

### Phase 1 — Discover the Thesis

One question at a time. The goal of this phase is to arrive at a **single declarative sentence** that answers "What is this video about?" — not the *topic*, but the *point*.

Start here and adapt:

1. **"What's the working topic of the video?"** — get the raw subject.
2. **"Who is the viewer you picture watching this, and what do they walk away believing, feeling, or able to do that they couldn't before?"** — force audience + transformation into focus.
3. **"If a viewer described this video to a friend in one sentence, what would you want them to say?"** — this often *is* the thesis, in the viewer's voice.
4. **"What's the tension or conflict? What belief are you challenging, what problem are you solving, or what surprise are you revealing?"** — videos without tension drift. Find the tension.
5. **Propose a thesis sentence.** Offer a candidate in the form: *"This video is about [X] — specifically, that [claim/tension/insight]."* Let the user react, sharpen, or reject it.
6. **Iterate until the thesis passes the tests** (below).

#### Thesis Tests

A good "What is it about?" sentence:
- **Is one sentence.** Not a paragraph. Not "and also."
- **Makes a claim.** "Sony FX30 autofocus" is a topic, not a thesis. "The FX30's autofocus is the reason solo creators can finally ditch a focus puller" is a thesis.
- **Has a stake.** There's something the viewer gains, loses, or reconsiders.
- **Excludes things.** If the thesis doesn't tell you what to *cut*, it's too broad.

If any test fails, keep interrogating. Do not advance to Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — Audit Against the Thesis

Once the thesis is locked, surface everything the user wants in the video — planned segments, demos, anecdotes, b-roll ideas, tangents. Then test each one:

> **"Does this segment serve the thesis? If you cut it, does the thesis survive?"**

For each candidate segment, ask the user — one at a time:

- **Direct service:** How does this advance the thesis?
- **If it doesn't:** Is it setup a viewer needs to understand the thesis? Or is it a darling to kill?
- **If it does but weakly:** Is there a tighter version? A shorter demo? A cut transition?

Be willing to say *"I think this one goes."* Push back; earn trust by being specific about what doesn't fit.

### Phase 3 — Produce the Outline

Only after thesis + audit are done. Output format:

```
# Video: [Working Title]

## Thesis (What is it about?)
[One sentence. The referee.]

## Audience & Payoff
- Viewer: [who]
- Walks away: [what changes for them]

## Outline

### 1. Cold Open / Hook (≈ 0:00–0:30)
- Beat: [what happens]
- Serves thesis by: [how]

### 2. [Segment name] (≈ 0:30–X:XX)
- Beat: [what happens]
- Serves thesis by: [how]

...

### N. Close / Call to Action
- Beat: [what happens]
- Serves thesis by: [how]

## Cut from scope (and why)
- [Segment] — [reason it didn't serve the thesis]
```

Every segment row MUST have a "Serves thesis by" line. If one can't be written, the segment doesn't belong.

## Rules

- **One question at a time.** Never batch. The user's answer to Q1 changes Q2.
- **Phase discipline.** Don't outline before the thesis is locked. Don't lock the thesis before testing it.
- **Propose, don't just ask.** When the thesis is forming, draft it and let the user react. Faster than pure Socratic.
- **Kill darlings out loud.** If a segment doesn't serve the thesis, say so. The user can overrule, but make them defend it.
- **Respect what's already decided.** If the user has production constraints (length, format, series style), honor them — the thesis works *within* the format.
- **Stop when done.** When the outline is produced and the user confirms, stop.

## Examples of Thesis Quality

**Weak (topic, not thesis):**
- "My video is about the Sigma 16mm lens."
- "I'm reviewing OBS for screencasting."

**Strong (thesis):**
- "The Sigma 16mm is the one lens that makes the FX30 feel like a different camera — and here's why it belongs on it by default."
- "Most OBS screencasting tutorials optimize for streamers; solo creators recording tutorials need a completely different scene setup, and the defaults are actively hurting you."

The weak versions don't tell you what to cut. The strong ones do.

## Anti-patterns

- **The "everything I know" video.** Symptom: outline has 8+ segments, each a mini-topic. Fix: the thesis isn't narrow enough.
- **The buried thesis.** Symptom: the real point shows up in segment 6. Fix: restructure so the thesis drives the opening.
- **The tutorial without tension.** Symptom: "here's how to do X" with no stakes. Fix: find what the viewer currently believes or does wrong — that's the tension.
