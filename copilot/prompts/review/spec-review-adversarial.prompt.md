  Adversarially reviews PRDs, requirements, user stories, or acceptance
  criteria using 1–3 lens reviewers (Skeptic, Coherence, Devil's Advocate);
  returns PASS/CONTESTED/REJECT verdict. Use before planning or sprint start,
  not for code review. For code, use domain-review instead.

> **Built-in first:** For light spec feedback, use `/review` with a spec file. Use this prompt when you need structured adversarial review with explicit verdict.

# Spec Review — Adversarial

Stress-test business analysis work products (requirements, user stories,
acceptance criteria, process flows, PRDs) by applying adversarial reviewer
lenses. Finds gaps, contradictions, and ambiguities BEFORE they become code
defects.

**This prompt reviews BA deliverables, not code.** For code, use `domain-review`.

## When to Use

- A BA has produced requirements, user stories, or acceptance criteria for review
- Validating a PRD or feature specification before implementation begins
- A work item's acceptance criteria need a quality check
- About to start a sprint and want to catch ambiguity early

## When NOT to Use

- Reviewing code — use `domain-review`
- Reviewing a code review — use `review-gauntlet`
- Purely technical deliverable (architecture doc, API spec) — use `domain-review` or a technical review

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load the Deliverable

Obtain the BA work product:

1. If a file path is provided, read the file
2. If an ADO or Linear ID is provided, fetch the work item and use its
   description + acceptance criteria
3. If inline text is provided, use that directly

Identify the deliverable type:
- **Requirements document** — contains "shall", "must", "requirement", numbered items
- **User stories** — contains "As a … I want … so that"
- **Acceptance criteria** — contains "Given/When/Then" or checkbox lists
- **Process flow** — contains sequential steps, decision points, swim lanes
- **PRD** — contains sections like Overview, Goals, User Personas, Features

### Step 2: Detect Phase

Determine the BA phase to select appropriate lenses. Auto-detect from
deliverable type, or use an explicit `--phase` argument to override:

| Phase | Typical Deliverables | Lenses |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| **Discovery** | Problem statement, stakeholder needs, market context | Skeptic, Devil's Advocate |
| **Analysis** | Requirements, process flows, gap analysis | Skeptic, Coherence, Devil's Advocate |
| **Specification** | User stories, acceptance criteria, detailed requirements | Skeptic, Coherence |
| **Validation** | Test plans mapped to requirements, traceability matrix | Coherence, Devil's Advocate |

### Step 3: Apply Reviewer Lenses

Apply each lens selected for the detected phase. Run all selected lenses before
moving to Step 4.

#### Skeptic Lens

The Skeptic questions every assumption and asks "how do you know?"

Checks for:
- **Unsupported claims.** "Users prefer X" — based on what evidence?
- **Vague quantifiers.** "Fast", "easy", "most users", "seamless" — define the threshold
- **Missing metrics.** Success criteria without measurable targets
- **Assumed context.** References to systems, processes, or terms not defined in the document
- **Happy path bias.** Only describes what happens when everything works — what about errors, edge cases, timeouts, partial failures?
- **Missing personas.** Who is "the user"? Are there different user types with different needs?

Finding format:
```
[SKEPTIC-<N>] <severity> | Section: <reference>
  Claim: "<quoted text>"
  Challenge: <what is wrong or missing>
  Evidence needed: <what would resolve this>
```

#### Coherence Lens

The Coherence reviewer checks internal consistency and completeness.

Checks for:
- **Contradictions.** Section A says X, Section B says not-X
- **Gaps in flow.** Step 3 produces output Y, but Step 4 expects input Z
- **Undefined terms.** A term is used but never defined, or defined differently in different places
- **Orphaned requirements.** A requirement is stated but no acceptance criteria cover it
- **Orphaned acceptance criteria.** AC exists but traces to no requirement
- **Missing states.** A status field has values A, B, C but the flow only describes transitions for A and B
- **Boundary ambiguity.** "Up to 10 items" — is 10 included? What happens at 11?
- **Implicit ordering.** Steps described without specifying whether they are sequential, parallel, or unordered

Finding format:
```
[COHERENCE-<N>] <severity> | Sections: <ref-A> vs <ref-B>
  Conflict: <what contradicts or is incomplete>
  Impact: <what goes wrong if this is not resolved>
  Suggestion: <how to fix>
```

#### Devil's Advocate Lens

The Devil's Advocate argues the opposite position and stress-tests decisions.

Checks for:
- **Alternative approaches.** "We chose X" — why not Y? What was the trade-off analysis?
- **Worst-case scenarios.** What if this feature is used maliciously? At 100x expected scale? By a confused user?
- **Stakeholder conflicts.** Does this serve all stakeholders, or does it optimize for one at the expense of another?
- **Future fragility.** This design works now, but what known upcoming changes would break it?
- **Reversibility.** If this decision is wrong, how hard is it to undo?
- **Second-order effects.** If we do X, what does that imply for Y and Z?

Finding format:
```
[DEVIL-<N>] <severity> | Section: <reference>
  Position: "<the decision or claim being challenged>"
  Counter: <the opposing argument>
  Risk if ignored: <what could go wrong>
```

### Step 4: Severity Classification

Each finding is classified:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Blocker** | Cannot proceed to implementation. Ambiguity or contradiction will cause incorrect code. |
| **High** | Significant gap that will likely cause rework or defects if not addressed. |
| **Medium** | Unclear area that could lead to misinterpretation. Should be clarified. |
| **Low** | Minor improvement. Nice to have but not blocking. |

### Step 5: Lead Judgment — Filter False Positives

After all lenses run, apply lead judgment to filter results:

1. **Remove pedantic findings.** If a finding is technically correct but
   practically irrelevant (e.g., "you said 'fast' but in context the SLA is
   clearly defined elsewhere"), discard it.
2. **Merge duplicates.** If two lenses flag the same issue, keep the one with
   the better explanation.
3. **Downgrade over-severity.** If a finding is marked Blocker but the actual
   impact is limited, downgrade it.
4. **Preserve genuine issues.** Do not filter findings just because they are
   uncomfortable. The point is to find real problems.

Mark filtered findings with a note: `[Filtered: <reason>]`

### Step 6: Verdict

Calculate the verdict from unfiltered findings:

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **PASS** | 0 Blockers, 0 High. Deliverable is ready for implementation. |
| **CONTESTED** | 0 Blockers, ≥1 High. Deliverable needs targeted revisions. |
| **REJECT** | ≥1 Blocker. Deliverable has fundamental issues that must be resolved before implementation. |

### Step 7: Report

Emit the report in this format:

```
BA Adversarial Review: <deliverable title or file>

  Phase:    <Discovery | Analysis | Specification | Validation>
  Lenses:   <list of lenses applied>
  Verdict:  <PASS | CONTESTED | REJECT>

Findings: <total> (<N> Blocker, <N> High, <N> Medium, <N> Low)
Filtered: <N> findings removed by lead judgment

```

## Hard Rules

1. **BA deliverables, not code.** This prompt reviews requirements, stories, and criteria. For code, use `domain-review`.
2. **Specific, evidence-based findings.** Every finding must cite a specific section, quote the relevant text, and explain the issue concretely. "This could be clearer" is not a finding.
3. **Lead judgment is mandatory.** Raw adversarial output is noisy. The filtering step separates signal from pedantry.
4. **"I would have written it differently" is NOT a finding.** Style preferences are not defects. Only flag issues that would cause implementation problems.
5. **Respect the phase.** Discovery deliverables are intentionally less precise than specifications. Apply phase-appropriate standards.
6. **Severity must be justified.** A Blocker must explain what specific implementation harm results. If you cannot articulate the harm, it is not a Blocker.
