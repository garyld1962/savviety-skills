# /skill:process-tune — Cross-Run Process Tuning

**Purpose:** consume the postmortem index, surface recurring
recommendations, and propose concrete artefact edits. This is the
*write* side of the auto-improve loop that `/skill:postmortem` and
the `## Postmortem` section of `claude/execute-plan/SKILL.md` feed.

The skill is **proposal-only by default.** It writes a tuning report
listing edits and the evidence behind them; the operator (or a
follow-on `/skill:execute-plan` run) makes the actual changes.

## When to Use

- At least 5 postmortems have landed in `docs/postmortems/index.json`
  and you want to act on the patterns.
- You suspect a specific gate, rubric, or closed-decision area is
  drifting and want the index queried for evidence.
- Periodically (monthly, quarterly) as part of a process-health
  review.

## When NOT to Use

- Fewer than ~3–5 postmortems exist for the recommendations being
  considered. A single postmortem flagging an issue is not signal — it
  may be a one-off run pathology. Wait for recurrence.
- You want to analyse a single run — use `/skill:postmortem` instead.
- You want to apply edits the proposal already names — that's
  `/skill:execute-plan` work; feed it a plan that wraps the edits.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `--index=<path>` | Path to the postmortem index. Default: `docs/postmortems/index.json`. |
| `--min-runs=<N>` | Minimum number of runs a recommendation must appear across before it's surfaced. Default: `3`. |
| `--since=<date>` | Only consider postmortems on or after this ISO date. Default: all rows. |
| `--target=<value>` | Filter to one taxonomy `target` (e.g. `adversarial-triggers`). Repeatable. Default: all. |
| `--type=<value>` | Filter to one taxonomy `type` (e.g. `tune-threshold`). Repeatable. Default: all. |
| `--report-path=<path>` | Where to write the tuning report. Default: `docs/postmortems/tuning-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`. |
| `--apply` | **Off by default.** When set, generate a `_internal/plan-format`-shaped artefact at `docs/plans/process-tune-<slug>.md` that captures each high-confidence proposal as a task. Does NOT execute it; that's still the operator's call. |
| `--schedule <cron>` | Register a recurring `/schedule` job to run `process-tune` automatically. Example: `--schedule "0 9 * * 1"` runs every Monday at 09:00. Requires `/schedule` to be available. Outputs the registered routine name and next run time. |

## Workflow

### 1. Load the index

Read `docs/postmortems/index.json` (or `--index=<path>`). If it
doesn't exist or is empty, halt:

```
No postmortems to tune from. /skill:postmortem hasn't run yet, or the index
is at a different path.
```

Apply the `--since`, `--target`, `--type` filters before grouping.

### 2. Group recommendations

Group every recommendation row across the filtered runs by the
composite key `(target, type)`. Within each group, count distinct
runs (deduplicate by `run` field — repeated postmortems on the same
run still count once) and aggregate the evidence.

Discard groups with fewer than `--min-runs` distinct runs.

### 3. Score each group

For each surviving group, compute:

- **frequency** — number of distinct runs flagging this `(target,
  type)` pair.
- **mean confidence** — average of the `confidence` values
  (`high=3`, `medium=2`, `low=1`).
- **actionability ratio** — fraction of recommendations in the group
  with `actionable: true`.
- **recency** — number of runs in the most recent 5 that flagged it.

These are scoring inputs, not user-facing fields. The skill picks
the surfacing order from them; the report ranks groups by
**frequency × mean-confidence × actionability-ratio**, with recency
as the tiebreaker.

### 4. Emit a tuning report

Write the markdown report at `--report-path`. Structure:

```
# Process Tuning Report

## Summary
- **Index:** docs/postmortems/index.json
- **Window:** <since>..<latest>  (<N> runs)
- **Filters:** target=<...> type=<...>
- **Surfaced groups:** <K>

## Recommendations

### Group 1: <target> / <type>  (<frequency> runs)

**Pattern:** <one sentence summarising the recurring complaint>

**Evidence:**
| Run | Recommendation summary | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-12-091200 | ... | high |
| 2026-04-19-141500 | ... | high |
| 2026-05-02-082000 | ... | medium |

**Proposed edit:**
<Concrete change, naming the file and the operation. Examples:
- "Lower `adversarial_triggers` threshold from 200 → 150 lines in
  the repo's CLAUDE.md ## Commands."
- "Add a closed decision at
  `closed-decisions/auth/session-cookie-name.md` with the value the
  last three plans re-debated."
- "Tighten domain-review profile `breakpoint` to also run the
  `tests-cover-changed-paths` check.">

**Risk of acting:** <one line — what could go wrong if applied>

**Confidence to act:** high | medium | low
```

Group order: highest score first.

### 5. Optional: emit an actionable plan

When `--apply` is set, also write a `_internal/plan-format`-shaped file at
`docs/plans/process-tune-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md` containing one
**Task** per `confidence: high` group. Each task names the file to
edit, the operation, and an acceptance bullet that's mechanically
verifiable (a `grep`, a numeric value, a closed-decision file
exists). The plan does NOT auto-execute — the operator chooses
whether to feed it to `/skill:execute-plan`.

This split (proposal-only vs. plan emission) is deliberate. Process
edits land in the same artefacts that govern future runs; an
auto-applied edit changes the rules of engagement without an
auditable approval. The plan path keeps the human in the loop while
removing the busy-work of authoring tasks from a known list of
groups.

### 6. Report

```
Tuning report: <report-path>
Surfaced groups: <K>  (<H> high-confidence, <M> medium, <L> low)
[--apply]    Plan emitted: <plan-path>  Run /skill:execute-plan to apply.
[--schedule] Routine registered: process-tune-<slug>  Next run: <datetime>
```

**Scheduling guidance:** If the project has an active execution pipeline (running `/skill:execute-prd` or `/skill:kickoff` regularly), `--schedule "0 9 * * 1"` establishes a weekly Monday morning tuning pass. The Dreaming feature (Claude Code's background session review) can surface raw signal automatically between runs; `process-tune` then acts on that accumulated signal in a structured way. At minimum one `--min-runs=3` cycle is needed before a scheduled run produces useful output.

## Hard rules

- **Read-only by default.** The skill writes a report and (when
  `--apply` is set) a plan file. It does NOT edit `_internal/`,
  `closed-decisions/`, `CLAUDE.md`, or any other governing artefact
  directly.
- **Frequency is the primary filter.** A single postmortem flagging an
  issue is below threshold, even if its `confidence` is `high`. Drift
  fixes that overfit to one run are themselves drift.
- **Recommendations the index can't ground go in a separate
  `Unsurfaced` section.** If a group has `target: other`, surface it
  in a tail section labelled "**Recommendations needing taxonomy
  extension**" so the taxonomy itself can be improved. Do not silently
  drop them.
- **The taxonomy is owned by the `## Postmortem` section of
  `claude/execute-plan/SKILL.md`.** If `/skill:process-tune` keeps proposing
  taxonomy changes, the change goes into that section's "Recommendation
  taxonomy" subsection, not into a parallel definition here.

## Things you must not do

- Do not synthesise recommendations the index doesn't contain. Every
  surfaced group must trace back to ≥`--min-runs` distinct
  postmortems.
- Do not edit governing artefacts directly, even when `--apply` is
  set. `--apply` produces a plan; the plan goes through
  `/skill:execute-plan` like any other change. Process edits get the same
  scrutiny as feature edits.
- Do not delete or rewrite rows in `docs/postmortems/index.json`. The
  index is append-only (see the `## Postmortem` section of
  `claude/execute-plan/SKILL.md`). Outdated
  recommendations stay as evidence; the scoring logic naturally
  weights recency.
- Do not run on an empty or near-empty index. The `--min-runs=3`
  default exists to prevent overfitting; lowering it is a smell.
