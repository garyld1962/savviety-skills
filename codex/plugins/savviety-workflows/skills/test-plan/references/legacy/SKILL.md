# /test-plan — TDD-First Test Planning

**Purpose:** Generate test specifications from task requirements BEFORE implementation. Tests serve as executable specifications that define what the code must do. Designed for iterative use by team agents in a TDD workflow. Project-agnostic — adapts to any TypeScript monorepo.

## When to Use

- Starting TDD on a new task — generate `it.todo()` stubs before implementation
- Validating whether an existing test suite covers the task requirements
- Refreshing a plan after requirements change

## When NOT to Use

- Implementation already exists and passes — use `/review-tests` to audit coverage
- Non-TypeScript repo without an equivalent test runner convention
- Exploratory spike code that will be discarded

## Usage

```
/test-plan --task="Implement vendor CRUD service"   # Plan + generate test files
/test-plan --validate                                # Run tests, report pass/fail
/test-plan --refresh                                 # Update plan after implementation changes
```

## Modes

### Full Plan (default — `--task="..."`)

Runs the complete orchestrator FSM. Produces test files with `it.todo()` stubs, a plan JSON file, and a markdown report. Use when starting a new feature.

### Validate (`--validate`)

Runs generated test files and reports results:
- Reads `.test-plan/plan-latest.json` to find generated test files
- Executes tests via Vitest: `pnpm vitest run --reporter=json {files}`
- Updates plan with pass/fail/todo counts
- Does NOT regenerate test files or write a new markdown report

### Refresh (`--refresh`)

Re-analyzes the task after implementation changes:
- Reads current implementation to discover new patterns and changed signatures
- Updates specs for evolved code
- Generates updated test files
- Archives old plan, writes new `plan-latest.json` and markdown report

## Project Discovery (Run Once at Start)

Before entering the FSM, load project context:

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** from repo root — learn project conventions, error handling, shared package, test framework
2. **Read `.test-plan/config.json`** if it exists — get team mappings, analyst overrides (see `foundations/project-config.md`)
3. **Read workspace config** — `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or root `package.json` `workspaces` field to discover package boundaries
4. **Identify shared package** — from config `sharedPackage` field, or auto-detect

This context is passed to every analyst.

## Orchestrator FSM (7 States)

### State 1: DISCOVER_ASK

Parse the task description to understand what's being built.

**Inputs:** `--task` argument, current branch name, agent prompt (if team agent)

**Extract:**
- **Entity**: The primary domain entity (vendor, rfi, task, change-order)
- **Package**: Target package (packages/api, packages/db, apps/web)
- **Layer**: Target layer (service, router, schema, component)
- **Operations**: What operations are being built (CRUD, transitions, calculations)

**Layer detection:** Use the task description first. If ambiguous, use file path patterns from `.test-plan/config.json` `layerDetection` field, or defaults:
- `**/services/**` → service
- `**/routers/**` → router
- `**/schema/**` → schema
- `**/*.tsx` → component

**For `--validate` mode:** Skip. Read existing plan from `.test-plan/plan-latest.json`.

**For `--refresh` mode:** Read existing plan, then re-parse to find changes.

### State 2: GATHER_CONTEXT

Read all relevant source files to build the specification context.

**Read in order:**
1. **Validation schemas** from the project's shared/types package for the target entity — input schemas, output types, enums
2. **DB schema** from the database package for the target entity — columns, types, defaults, relations, status enums
3. **Enum definitions** from the shared package — status values, categories
4. **Reference implementation** — find an existing service/router for a similar entity to learn the established patterns
5. **CLAUDE.md conventions** — error handling patterns, logging, boundary rules, testing expectations

6. **Classify dependencies** using `_internal/dependency-classification/SKILL.md`.

   For each dependency in scope of the target, record `<name> — <category> — <chosen test approach>` in the plan output. Flag miscategorizations (e.g., Postgres mocked rather than substituted with PGLite) as findings. Never mock in-process or local-substitutable dependencies — the rubric explains why.

**For `--validate` mode:** Skip. Context already in plan file.

### State 3: SELECT_ANALYSTS

Choose which analysts to run based on the target layer:

| Target Layer | Analysts |
|-------------|----------|
| service | contract-compliance, state-lifecycle, boundary-validation, integration-surface |
| router | contract-compliance, boundary-validation, integration-surface |
| schema | contract-compliance, boundary-validation |
| component | contract-compliance, boundary-validation, integration-surface |

Check `.test-plan/config.json` `analysts` field for overrides (enabled/disabled).

**State-lifecycle exception:** Only include `state-lifecycle` if the entity has a status enum. If no status field exists, skip even for service layer.

**For `--validate` mode:** Skip. Analysts determined by existing plan.

### State 4: DISPATCH_ANALYSTS

For each selected analyst:
1. Read `test-plan/analysts/{name}/SKILL.md`
2. Pass the task context, Zod schemas, DB schema, reference implementation, and CLAUDE.md conventions
3. Analyst produces `TestSpecification[]` (see `foundations/test-case-schema.md`)

Analysts run conceptually in parallel — each operates on the same context independently.

**For `--validate` mode:** Skip. Specifications already in plan file.

### State 5: CONSOLIDATE_PLAN

Merge analyst outputs into a unified plan:

1. **Deduplicate**: If two analysts produced specs for the same behavior (same testFile + describeBlock + similar testName), keep the higher-priority one. If same priority, keep the one with more assertions.

2. **Assign to test files**: Group specs by `testFile` path. Each unique path becomes one generated file.

3. **Calculate summary**: Count totals by priority, analyst, and category.

4. **Determine verdict**:
   - **READY**: All P1 specs generated, context was complete
   - **PARTIAL**: P1 specs generated but some context was missing (e.g., no Zod schema found)
   - **BLOCKED**: Critical context missing (no entity found, no schemas, can't determine layer)

**For `--validate` mode:** Skip. Proceed to running tests.

### State 6: GENERATE_OUTPUT

#### Full/Refresh Mode

1. **Generate test files**: Pass grouped specs to the test writer (see `test-writer/SKILL.md`). The test writer creates `.test.ts` files with `it.todo()` stubs.

2. **Write plan JSON**: Write `.test-plan/plan-latest.json` conforming to `foundations/plan-schema.md`.
   - Archive existing `plan-latest.json` to `plan-{planId}.json` first (if exists)

3. **Write markdown report**: Use template from `foundations/report-template.md`. Save to `docs/test-plans/`.

4. **Update report index**: Prepend to `docs/test-plans/index.md`. Update `docs/test-plans/latest.md`.

#### Validate Mode

1. **Run tests**: Execute generated test files:
   ```bash
   pnpm vitest run --reporter=json {test-file-paths}
   ```

2. **Parse results**: Count passed, failed, todo tests.

3. **Calculate validation verdict**:
   - **ALL_PASS**: All non-todo tests pass
   - **PARTIAL_PASS**: Some pass, some fail
   - **FAILING**: >50% of non-todo tests fail

4. **Update plan**: Add `validation` field to `.test-plan/plan-latest.json`. Bump timestamp.

### State 7: RESPOND

Present summary to the caller.

#### Full/Refresh Mode Response

```
Test Plan: {entity}.{layer} — {verdict}

Task: "{task description}"
Analysts: {list}

Specs: {total} ({p1} P1, {p2} P2, {p3} P3)

Generated files:
  {path} — {testCount} tests ({todoCount} todos)

Plan: .test-plan/plan-latest.json
Report: {reportPath}

Next steps:
  1. Review generated test files
  2. Implement the feature, making tests pass in P1 → P2 → P3 order
  3. Run /test-plan --validate when ready
```

#### Validate Mode Response

```
Test Plan Validation: {entity}.{layer} — {validation verdict}

Results: {passed} passed, {failed} failed, {todo} todo

{If FAILING: list failed tests with error messages}

Plan updated: .test-plan/plan-latest.json

Next steps:
  {ALL_PASS: "Proceed to /code-review"}
  {PARTIAL_PASS: "Fix failing tests, then re-validate"}
  {FAILING: "Major implementation issues — review failing tests"}
```

**Critical:** Always include the plan file path in your response. The calling team agent needs this to track progress.

## Team Agent Integration

This skill is designed for TDD use by team agents. The typical lifecycle:

```
task received → /test-plan --task="..."    (generate specs)
implementing  → fill in it.todo() stubs   (TDD)
"done"        → /test-plan --validate      (verify tests pass)
refactored    → /test-plan --refresh       (update specs)
passing       → /code-review               (quality check)
clean         → create PR
```

See `foundations/team-agent-protocol.md` for the complete workflow.

## Integration with Code Review

The test-plan and code-review skills are complementary:

| Skill | When | What |
|-------|------|------|
| `/test-plan` | Before implementation | Defines what the code SHOULD do |
| `/code-review` | After implementation | Verifies how the code IS written |

Both must pass before creating a PR. See `foundations/team-agent-protocol.md` for the combined workflow.
